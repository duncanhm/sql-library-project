Tables and queries for a fictional library system database

I put together a simple database in Microsoft SQL Server, replicating a library system database in a fictional city. There are six tables total, connected by foreign keys in such a way as to be practical for querying data on the location of books among libraries and with loanees. I also included a number of example queries at the end of the file on my GitHub page. You will find the link to my project below.
